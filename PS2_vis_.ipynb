        "The final proposed research aims to explore the relationship between Grade 2 test scores and National Scholarship Test scores in Kyrgyzstan. Specifically, the study will examine how these scores vary across regions, languages of instruction, and subnational socio-economic indicators. This research is significant because prior studies in international education emphasize that early-grade literacy and numeracy acquisition is critical for future learning success. Those who do not learn to level early, will struggle to catch up in the future and see their educational progress and outcomes stymied as a result.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding whether disparities in test scores observed at later stages are present as early as Grade 2 will help inform education policy. Equipped with this information, policymakers could assess the effectiveness of maintaining two official languages and the impacts of urbanization on educational equity.\n",
        "Research Aim: Testing\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary aim of this research is to primarily investigate the correlation between early-grade learning outcomes and later academic performance, using a lens of region, language, and subnational data to further explore the relationships. The research draws on the following insights from the literature:\n",
        "1.\tEarly-grade literacy and numeracy acquisition are critical and serves as a strong predictor of future academic success.\n",
        "2.\tKyrgyzstan is a multilingual country with two official languages (Kyrgyz and Russian), with other local languages spoken depending on ethnic background.\n",
        "3.\tRapid population growth and urbanization have concentrated wealth, opportunities, and funding in the capital, Bishkek.\n",
        "4.\tKyrgyzstan’s geography presents significant challenges to its educational system due to hazardous mountain passes, frequent natural disasters (e.g., landslides), and the remoteness of many schools.\n",
        "5.\tNational Scholarship Test scores show disparities based on language of instruction and geography: students taking the test in Russian and those in Bishkek consistently perform better than their peers in other regions.\n",
        "Based on this information, this research will test whether these factors can be linked to disparities in early-grade educational outcomes. The hypothesis is that regional, linguistic, and socio-economic differences will be seen to be present at Grade 2, and will contribute to ongoing long-term disparities in academic achievement, as reflected in current scholarship testing outcomes. This would indicate the problem is more systematic and continuing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Proposed Research Questions\n",
        "1.\tCan the regional and linguistic disparities observed in National Scholarship Test scores also be identified as early as Grade 2?\n",
        "2.\tHow does the language of instruction affect Grade 2 reading and numeracy scores within and across regions?\n"

        "So! What's the takeaway with the National Scholarship Test scores?\n",
        "Results in Russian are typically better, both on average and for those who are awarded.\n",
        "Prior calculations shown (will graph this later!) indicate that there is a higher likelyhood of a Kyrgyz test taker, with a lower score, successfully receiving a scholarship. Researchers noted that 1) quotas and 2) high scoring students may both seek outside opportunities if not awarded a scholarship to a top university in higher paying disciplines.\n",
        "I would say, from a glance, that these two heatmaps show that the conclusions from Shamatov and Bahry's study on NST test results in 2017 stay true. Higher educational results and outcomes are seen coming from Bishkek and Osh city, urban centers and unique administrative regions with higher opportunities."
